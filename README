This database is updated until April 27th 2017
All crystal structures are with resolution <= 3.0 A

required package for running MismatchPDB:
pandas v 0.18.1
numpy v 1.11.2
json v 2.0.9

written library:
common
learna_json
commontool

pull_pdb_all.py
is to loop all the PDB file in ./Crystal directory, generate a array text file containing
all the PDB id in alphabet order. Please copy this output All_crystal.txt into ./PDBinfo 

pdbToStem.py
is to use DSSR to read all PDB file. output the stem structure file (dssr-stems.pdb) and json file
and then use pdblib to correct the format of each PDB including adding TER at the right position
to make sure there are only two segments (strands) within one stem, the output stem structure files
are in ./Stem

check_json.py
is to check the sanity of the json files in ./Json

pull_stem_list.py
is to generate a stemTofrag.txt file, which contains all the stem structure files in ./Stem
with corresponding requirement (like category is RNA and resolution is below 3.0 A).

copy paste stemTofrag.txt to stem_5bps_dna/rna_crystal folder for DNA entries and RNA entries, respectively

in each folder (stem_5bps_dna/rna_crystal), run
Process_stemTofrag_nts.py
Process_stemTofrag_abg.py
Process_nts.py
Process_abg.py
Process_sugar.py


These will output, Output_seq.txt, Output_nts.txt, Output_abg.txt and Output_sugar.txt
